\usage{
facefuns2d(
  data,
  remove_points = NULL,
  pc_criterion = "broken_stick",
  plot_sample = TRUE,
  auto_rotate = TRUE,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Three-dimensional array of dimensions p, k, and n. p = number of landmarks, k = dimension (2D or 3D), n = number of specimens}

\item{remove_points}{Specify any points/lamdmarks you want to remove. See \link[facefuns]{remove_points} and \link[facefuns]{frl_features}}

\item{pc_criterion}{Criterion used to choose which PCs to retain. See \link[facefuns]{select_pcs}}

\item{plot_sample}{Plot sample to check data. See \link[geomorph]{plotAllSpecimens}}

\item{auto_rotate}{Landmark templates are sometimes no longer upright after Procrustes-alignment. Auto-rotate uses \link[geomorph]{rotate.coords} to guess which type of rotation is required}

\item{quiet}{Print short summary of loaded data}
}
\value{
Returns a list of the following components:
\item{aligned}{Three-dimensional array containing Procrustes-aligned data}
\item{average}{Coordinates of sample average for plotting}
\item{pc_info}{List of selected PCs (including their SD, variance explained and cumulative variance explained), number of selected PCs, criterion used to select PCs}
\item{pc_scores}{Principal component scores}
\item{pc_plot}{PCs for plotting. Will by default create list of coordinates for all selected PCs at +/- 3SDs. To create plots of other PCs or at different level of SD, please see \link[facefuns]{plot_2dpcs}}
\item{summary}{Short summary of key descriptives}
}

Performs some of the routine steps for getting landmark data ready for shape analyses, such as Procrustes alignment and principal component analysis. For more details see vignette:
