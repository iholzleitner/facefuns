\title{Calculate fluctuating asymmetry}
\usage{
calcFA(data, mirr_lms)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Quickstart object or three-dimensional array of dimensions p, k, and n}

\item{mirr_lms}{Vector specifying order of mirrored landmarks}
}
\value{
Returns tibble containing ID and FA scores
}
\description{
\lifecycle{maturing}

Calculates fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of landmark templates. FA scores are calculated as Euclidean distance between original and symmetrised templates, corrected for directional asymmetry of sample
