Miscellaneous convenience functions around geometric morphometric analyses of 2D and 3D face data. A brief intro can be found [here](https://iholzleitner.github.io/facefuns/articles/facefuns.html)!

## Installation

You can install the development version of `facefuns` from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

```
